# Kuttl test doesn't seem to wait correctly for the metric
# storage to reconcile in the next test step when switching
# to CustomMonitoringStack (in the output of the test I
# can see it applyes the resource and fails a second later).
# Deleting it here and than recreating it in the next step
# should ensure kuttl waits long enough.
